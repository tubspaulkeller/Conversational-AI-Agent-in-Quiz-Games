### Abstract 

The interaction among learners plays a crucial role in the learning process as it fosters a sense of community and can generate positive relational effects. However, there is often a lack of motivation in collaborative environments, affecting collaboration. Nevertheless, gamified elements can be integrated into the collaborative process. Pedagogical Conversational Agents (PCAs) take on a guiding and moderating role to support learners and effectively control gamified elements. This work focuses on a gamified PCA named Ben, who acts as a moderator for a quiz game and a motivator. Ben offers various game modes for individual and group learning: solitary learning (OKK), collaborative learning (KL), competitive learning without collaboration (KLOK), and competitive learning with collaboration (KLMK). The goal was to determine which mode most positively influences learner's motivation. The study was conducted as part of Design Science Research through a 2x2 experiment (n=120). Significant differences between competitive game modes (KLMK & KLOK) were found using a two-factor ANOVA. Additionally, a structural equation model highlighted significant direct effects of the KLMK mode on learner's intrinsic motivation and the perceived helpfulness of the gamified PCA (Ben). On the other hand, the model revealed significant indirect effects of the KLMK mode. These effects relate to both learner's enjoyment & satisfaction and the perceived utility of competitive & collaborative gamified PCA interaction, with intrinsic motivation serving as a mediator in both cases. 
The following video (in German) will show the different play modes.
